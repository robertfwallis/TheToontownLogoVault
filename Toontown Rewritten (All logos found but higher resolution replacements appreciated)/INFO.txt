It is of my understanding that most, if not all of Rewritten's logos were likely exported at a resolution of 3000x1500. This is evident in the fact that the Pre-Beta and Open Beta logos are this resolution. I consider these two to be "complete".
I am unsure if the Live or RewritTEN versions of the logo follow this, but all of the Pre-Alpha to Open Beta (noted as 1 through 5) logos were created by Piranhartist.
